A Website developed in Django Python that was used to calculate Integral and Derivative of Equation that we will provide in an Input field that is shown on the Homepage.

Here are the following Mathematical Models that are embedded in this website.

1) Piston
2) Pulleys
3) Trigonometry Ratio
4) Distribution Formula
5) Normal Distribution Formula
6) Logarithms


There is a description of each model and then there is a relative graph to give a visualization of the Model which you are viewing.
